            <p>Jotto is a fun word game where you have to guess a secret 5-letter 
            word by asking how many letters from other 5 letter words are in
            the secret word. Note that the secret word may not have repeating
            characters, but in this version of the game, the words you ask can.</p>
            
            <p>For example, suppose the secret word was <strong>phone</strong>. If
            I were to start with the word <strong>tooth</strong>, then the game 
            would tell me 3 of my letters are in the secret word. This would lead
            me to belive that the letter <strong>h</strong> is definitely in the
            secret word, and furthermore, either <strong>t</strong> or <strong>o</strong>
            as well. Through the power of deduction, one must try to guess the
            secret word in as few guesses as possible.</p>
            
            <p>Note that at the bottom of the game area there is an alphabet.
            This should help you keep track of which letters you are certain are
            part of the word or not.</p>
            
            <p>Jotto was invented by Morton Rosenfeld in 1955. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jotto">Wikipedia</a>
